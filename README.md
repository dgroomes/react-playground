## Description

[This repository](https://github.com/dgroomes/react-playground) is for my own personal use as I learn React. It implements
a React project that features JSX, Markdown and **zero build tooling**. It's hosted in [GitHub pages](https://dgroomes.github.io/react-playground/).

React, Babel and Marked are loaded as script tags. Babel transpiles the ESNext source code on-the-fly in the browser. Likewise, Marked compiles the source
Markdown files into HTML on-the-fly in the browser.

This project was originally scaffolded using the example project <https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html>. 

## Instructions

Follow these instructions to serve the app (rejoice in the fact that there's no build step!):

1. Serve the source code:
   * `python3 serve.py`
   * Note: If you are on macOS then Python 3 and its built-in modules are already installed on your computer! If you are not on
     macOS, then you may need to install Python. See <https://www.python.org/downloads/>.
2. Open the browser!
   * Open <http://localhost:8080> in your browser

## Reference

* React <https://reactjs.org/> *A JavaScript library for building user interfaces*
* Babel <https://babeljs.io/> *The compiler for next generation JavaScript*
* Marked <https://marked.js.org/> *A markdown parser and compiler. Built for speed.*
