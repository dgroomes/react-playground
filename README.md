## Standalone sub-projects

This repository illustrates different concepts, patterns and examples via standalone sub-projects. Each sub-project is
completely independent of the others and do not depend on the root project. This _standalone sub-project constraint_
forces the sub-projects to be complete and maximizes the reader's chances of successfully running, understanding, and
re-using the code.

The sub-projects include:

## `babel-standalone/`

A *zero-build-step* React project implemented with Babel's in-browser compiler `@babel/standalone`. This is React *the CDN way*.

See the README in [babel-standalone/](babel-standalone/).

## `vite/`

A React project built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). It features TypeScript.

See the README in [vite/](vite/).

## `webpack`

A React project built with [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/). It features TypeScript and `ts-loader`.

See the README in [webpack/](webpack/).

## `esbuild`

A bare-bones React and TypeScript project built with [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/).

See the README in [esbuild/](esbuild/).

## `flat-ui`

Learning and exploring the 'flat-ui' React component library.

See the README in [flat-ui/](flat-ui/).
