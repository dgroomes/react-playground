# vite

A React project built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). It features TypeScript.

## Description

I scaffolded this project with npm's awesome [`init` command](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-init) in combination
with Vite's `init` *initializer* which let me easily declare "I want a React and TypeScript project". Very cool. I wish
Gradle had this feature. I'm sure they have been thinking about it for a long time and will one day get it. Here is the
related [Gradle feature request](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/1686).

## Instructions

Follow these instructions to build and serve the app:

1. Install dependencies:
   * `npm install`
2. Run the server:
   * `npm run dev`
3. Open the browser:
   * <http://localhost:3000/>

## Wish List

General clean ups, todos and things I wish to implement for this project:

* What is the Vite way to do CSS? Do we bundle the CSS into the JavaScript bundle file (the Webpack way)? 

## Reference
