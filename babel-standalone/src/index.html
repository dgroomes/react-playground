    When you want to upgrade the versions of these libraries, find their latest releases at these places:

    React: https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md
    Babel: https://github.com/babel/babel/releases

    You will also want to visit "unpkg" to get the exact version values and use https://www.srihash.org to generate the
    integrity hash.

    <!-- Use Babel to *load* (and transpile) JSX source code. We are using in-browser JSX (no build step)! This works
     because we have loaded the "babel/standalone" library and have specified the source type of "text/babel" in the
     script tag. The browser will key off the "text/babel" type and then hook into the Babel standalone component to
     transpile the JSX source code into browser compatible JS source code. Then, the browser will load and
     execute that JS source code. Pretty cool!
